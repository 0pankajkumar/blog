      <description> Lessions learnt  The corner cases of testing cases will annoy you. In geeksforgeeks practice they gave back the case whenever you had a failure in submission. Actual cases in competitive programming will not have that luxury. You&amp;rsquo;ll not have that kind of cushion there. Try to make your own corner cases.  </description>

      <description>So, one day I was using too much list &amp;amp; wondered why we can’t use dict all the time when it has O(1) time complexity. Instead of pondering I tried to measure things myself &amp;amp; see. I ended up measuring access time in a dict &amp;amp; in a list. Below is the code.
import time d = dict() for i in range(10000000): d[i] = True e = list() for i in range(10000000): e.</description>

      <description>My first Cookoff Last night I was participating in CodeChef October Cookoff for the first time. It was a good experience even though I could solve one problem completely &amp;amp; two others partially attempted out of total five.
So, there’s a language debate over which should be better for competitive programming. I natively speak in python though I started off with C/C++ family. So, let’s see some comparison over a brute force solution to a problem written in Python (A slow language) and C++ (A fast language).</description>
